I noticed there was no light mode design for the textarea so I styled it myself.

Browser compatibility issue: it seems firefox doesn't allow you to set the content of a textarea directly in the markup. This won't be an issue because character-counter expects the user to type/paste in their own text and will not provide default content.

Improvement: instead of translate for the card backgound images, we could use absolute postioning instead. The current implementation looks weird for certain screen sizes

# TODO:

- [ ] refactor: use BEM-style css class names throughout the styling.
- [ ] fix: style the checkboxes.
